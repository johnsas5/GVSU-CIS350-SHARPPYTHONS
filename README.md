# Sharp Pythons

Our team is looking to build a website to act as a budget tool for those using it. The back-end will be handled with Python and the front-end with HTML and CSS. Some features we would like to deploy include: forms that prompt users to input data, an expense counter, graphs to show future savings, a retirement section, and age based financial suggestions.
