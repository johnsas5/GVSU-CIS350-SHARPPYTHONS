# Introduction

Our Budget Tool webiste will be designed to help users effectively manage their finances by providing a user-friendly interface. The back-end will be configured with Python allowing for scalable solutions, while the front-end will be constructed with React. The tools available will let users track their expenses and savings with options that automatically counts savings as an expense. A key feature we would like to implement includes a graphical representation of an individuals future savings, based on inputted monthly savings, allowing them to visualize their financial trajectory. Furthermore, the platform will prompt users to enter relevant financial data, ensuring a personalized experience tailored to their specific needs.
We would also like to include a retirement section, possibly integrated with the already described savings feature. This would help our users plan for their long-term desires. Another useful feature would be a connection with Google Calendar. When payments are approaching, users will be notified of their unhandled expenses helping the flow of their financial organization. Suggestions will be based on a multitude of factors with age being a primary influence. Younger individuals will recieve aggressive suggestions in order to maximize their potential savings. Ultimatey, our Budget Tool website will hopefully become a financial workplace, making money management an easy task for all.
